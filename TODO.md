TODO
====

* Need to implement 'variations', kind of like traits are used in factories.  This could be used to differentiate between different types of orders.
* Flush out the documentation more and review how FactoryGirl.define works.
* Figure out how to create new instances of data, e.g. what if I want to create 100 orders and not just one.
